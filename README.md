## Features at a Glance or [Full Features Wiki](https://github.com/error311/FileRise/wiki/Features)

- üöÄ **Easy File Uploads:** Upload multiple files and folders via drag & drop or file picker. Supports large files with pause/resumable chunked uploads and shows real-time progress for each file. No more failed transfers ‚Äì FileRise will pick up where it left off if your connection drops.

- üóÇÔ∏è **File Management:** Full set of file/folder operations ‚Äì move or copy files (via intuitive drag-drop or dialogs), rename items, and delete in batches. You can even download selected files as a ZIP archive or extract uploaded ZIP files server-side. Organize content with an interactive folder tree and breadcrumb navigation for quick jumps.

- üóÉÔ∏è **Folder Sharing & File Sharing:** Easily share entire folders via secure, expiring public links. Folder shares can be password-protected, and shared folders support file uploads from outside users with a separate, secure upload mechanism. Folder listings are paginated (10 items per page) with navigation controls, and file sizes are displayed in MB for clarity. Share files with others using one-time or expiring public links (with password protection if desired) ‚Äì convenient for sending individual files without exposing the whole app.

- üîå **WebDAV Support:** Mount FileRise as a network drive **or use it head‚Äëless from the CLI**. Standard WebDAV operations (upload / download / rename / delete) work in Cyberduck, WinSCP, GNOME Files, Finder, etc., and you can also script against it with `curl` ‚Äì see the [WebDAV](https://github.com/error311/FileRise/wiki/WebDAV)¬†+¬†[curl](https://github.com/error311/FileRise/wiki/Accessing-FileRise-via-curl%C2%A0(WebDAV)) quick‚Äëstart for examples. Folder‚ÄëOnly users are restricted to their personal directory, while admins and unrestricted users have full access.

- üìö **API Documentation:** Fully auto‚Äëgenerated OpenAPI spec (`openapi.json`) and interactive HTML docs (`api.html`) powered by Redoc.

- üìù **Built-in Editor & Preview:** View images, videos, audio, and PDFs inline with a preview modal ‚Äì no need to download just to see them. Edit text/code files right in your browser with a CodeMirror-based editor featuring syntax highlighting and line numbers. Great for config files or notes ‚Äì tweak and save changes without leaving FileRise.

- üè∑Ô∏è **Tags & Search:** Categorize your files with color-coded tags and locate them instantly using our indexed real-time search. Easily switch to Advanced Search mode to enable fuzzy matching not only across file names, tags, and uploader fields but also within the content of text files‚Äîhelping you find that ‚Äúimportant‚Äù document even if you make a typo or need to search deep within the file.

- üîí **User Authentication & User Permissions:** Secure your portal with username/password login. Supports multiple users ‚Äì create user accounts (admin UI provided) for family or team members. User permissions such as User ‚ÄúFolder Only‚Äù feature assigns each user a dedicated folder within the root directory, named after their username, restricting them from viewing or modifying other directories. User Read Only and Disable Upload are additional permissions. FileRise also integrates with Single Sign-On (OIDC) providers (e.g., OAuth2/OIDC for Google/Authentik/Keycloak) and offers optional TOTP two-factor auth for extra security.

- üé® **Responsive UI (Dark/Light Mode):** FileRise is mobile-friendly out of the box ‚Äì manage files from your phone or tablet with a responsive layout. Choose between Dark mode or Light theme, or let it follow your system preference. The interface remembers your preferences (layout, items per page, last visited folder, etc.) for a personalized experience each time.

- üåê **Internationalization & Localization:** FileRise supports multiple languages via an integrated i18n system. Users can switch languages through a user panel dropdown, and their choice is saved in local storage for a consistent experience across sessions. Currently available in English, Spanish, French & German‚Äîplease report any translation issues you encounter.

- üóëÔ∏è **Trash & File Recovery:** Mistakenly deleted files? No worries ‚Äì deleted items go to the Trash instead of immediate removal. Admins can restore files from Trash or empty it to free space. FileRise auto-purges old trash entries (default 3 days) to keep your storage tidy.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Lightweight & Self‚ÄëContained:** FileRise runs on PHP 8.1+ with no external database required ‚Äì data is stored in files (users, metadata) for simplicity. It‚Äôs a single‚Äëfolder web app you can drop into any Apache/PHP server or run as a container. Docker & Unraid ready: use our pre‚Äëbuilt image for a hassle‚Äëfree setup. Memory and CPU footprint is minimal, yet the app scales to thousands of files with pagination and sorting features.

## Installation & Setup

You can deploy FileRise either by running the **Docker container** (quickest way) or by a **manual installation** on a PHP web server. Both methods are outlined below.

---

### 1) Running with Docker (Recommended)

#### Pull the image

```bash
docker pull error311/filerise-docker:latest
```

#### Run a container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name filerise \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -e TIMEZONE="America/New_York" \
  -e DATE_TIME_FORMAT="m/d/y  h:iA" \
  -e TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE="5G" \
  -e SECURE="false" \
  -e PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY="please_change_this_@@" \
  -e PUID="1000" \
  -e PGID="1000" \
  -e CHOWN_ON_START="true" \
  -e SCAN_ON_START="true" \
  -e SHARE_URL="" \
  -v ~/filerise/uploads:/var/www/uploads \
  -v ~/filerise/users:/var/www/users \
  -v ~/filerise/metadata:/var/www/metadata \
  error311/filerise-docker:latest
```

This starts FileRise on port **8080** ‚Üí visit `http://your-server-ip:8080`.

**Notes**  

- **Do not use** Docker `--user`. Use **PUID/PGID** to map on-disk ownership (e.g., `1000:1000`; on Unraid typically `99:100`).
- `CHOWN_ON_START=true` is recommended on **first run** to normalize ownership of existing trees. Set to **false** later for faster restarts.
- `SCAN_ON_START=true` runs a one-time index of files added outside the UI so their metadata appears.
- `SHARE_URL` is optional; leave blank to auto-detect from the current host/scheme. You can set it to your site root (e.g., `https://files.example.com`) or directly to the full endpoint.
- Set `SECURE="true"` if you serve via HTTPS at your proxy layer.

**Verify ownership mapping (optional)**  

```bash
docker exec -it filerise id www-data
# expect: uid=1000 gid=1000   (or 99/100 on Unraid)
```

#### Using Docker Compose

Save as `docker-compose.yml`, then `docker-compose up -d`:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  filerise:
    image: error311/filerise-docker:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      TIMEZONE: "UTC"
      DATE_TIME_FORMAT: "m/d/y  h:iA"
      TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE: "10G"
      SECURE: "false"
      PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY: "please_change_this_@@"
      # Ownership & indexing
      PUID: "1000"              # Unraid users often use 99
      PGID: "1000"              # Unraid users often use 100
      CHOWN_ON_START: "true"    # first run; set to "false" afterwards
      SCAN_ON_START: "true"     # index files added outside the UI at boot
      # Sharing URL (optional): leave blank to auto-detect from host/scheme
      SHARE_URL: ""
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/var/www/uploads
      - ./users:/var/www/users
      - ./metadata:/var/www/metadata
```

FileRise will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or your server‚Äôs IP).  
The example also sets a custom `PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY` (used to encrypt ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù tokens)‚Äîchange it to a strong random string.

**First-time Setup**  
On first launch, if no users exist, you‚Äôll be prompted to create an **Admin account**. After logging in, use **User Management** to add more users.

---

### 2) Manual Installation (PHP/Apache)

If you prefer to run FileRise on a traditional web server (LAMP stack or similar):

**Requirements**  

- PHP **8.3+**
- Apache (mod_php) or another web server configured for PHP
- PHP extensions: `json`, `curl`, `zip` (and typical defaults). No database required.

**Download Files**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/error311/FileRise.git
```

Place the files in your web root (e.g., `/var/www/`). Subfolder installs are fine.

**Composer (if applicable)**
If you use optional features requiring Composer libraries, run:

```bash
composer install
```

**Folders & Permissions**  

```bash
mkdir -p uploads users metadata
chown -R www-data:www-data uploads users metadata   # use your web user
chmod -R 775 uploads users metadata
```

- `uploads/`: actual files  
- `users/`: credentials & token storage  
- `metadata/`: file metadata (tags, share links, etc.)

**Configuration**  

Open `config.php` and consider:

- `TIMEZONE`, `DATE_TIME_FORMAT` for your locale.
- `TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE` (also ensure your PHP `upload_max_filesize` & `post_max_size` meet/exceed this).
- `PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY` set to a unique secret if using ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù.

**Share links base URL**  

- You can set **`SHARE_URL`** via your web server environment variables (preferred),  
  **or** keep using `BASE_URL` in `config.php` as a fallback for manual installs.
- If neither is set, FileRise auto-detects from the current host/scheme.

**Web Server Config**  

- Apache: allow `.htaccess` or merge its rules; ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled.
- Nginx/other: replicate the basic protections (no directory listing, deny sensitive files). See Wiki for examples.

Now browse to your FileRise URL; you‚Äôll be prompted to create the Admin user on first load.

---

## Quick‚Äëstart: Mount via WebDAV

Once FileRise is running, you must enable WebDAV in admin panel to access it.

```bash
# Linux (GVFS/GIO)
gio mount dav://demo@your-host/webdav.php/

# macOS (Finder ‚Üí Go ‚Üí Connect to Server‚Ä¶)
dav://demo@your-host/webdav.php/

```

### Windows (File Explorer)

- Open **File Explorer** ‚Üí Right-click **This PC** ‚Üí **Map network drive‚Ä¶**
- Choose a drive letter (e.g., `Z:`).
- In **Folder**, enter:

  ```text
  https://your-host/webdav.php/
  ```

- Check **Connect using different credentials**, and enter your FileRise username and password.
- Click **Finish**. The drive will now appear under **This PC**.

> **Important:**  
> Windows requires HTTPS (SSL) for WebDAV connections by default.  
> If your server uses plain HTTP, you must adjust a registry setting:
>
> 1. Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit.exe`).
> 2. Navigate to:
>
>    ```text
>    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters
>    ```
>
> 3. Find or create a `DWORD` value named **BasicAuthLevel**.
> 4. Set its value to `2`.
> 5. Restart the **WebClient** service or reboot your computer.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúUpload failed‚Äù or large files not uploading:** Make sure `TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE` in config and PHP‚Äôs `post_max_size` / `upload_max_filesize` are all set high enough. For extremely large files, you might also need to increase max_execution_time in PHP or rely on the resumable upload feature in smaller chunks.

- **How to enable HTTPS?** FileRise itself doesn‚Äôt handle TLS. Run it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx, Caddy, or Apache with SSL, or use Docker with a companion like nginx-proxy or Caddy. Set `SECURE="true"` env var in Docker so FileRise knows to generate https links.

- **Changing Admin or resetting password:** Admin can change any user‚Äôs password via the UI (User Management section). If you lose admin access, you can edit the `users/users.txt` file on the server ‚Äì passwords are hashed (bcrypt), but you can delete the admin line and then restart the app to trigger the setup flow again.

- **Where are my files stored?** In the `uploads/` directory (or the path you set for `UPLOAD_DIR`). Within it, files are organized in the folder structure you see in the app. Deleted files move to `uploads/trash/`. Tag information is in `metadata/file_metadata`.json and trash metadata in `metadata/trash.json`, etc. Regular backups of these folders is recommended if the data is important.

- **Updating FileRise:** If using Docker, pull the new image and recreate the container. For manual installs, download the latest release and replace the files (preserve your `config.php` and the uploads/users/metadata folders). Clear your browser cache if you have issues after an update (in case CSS/JS changed).
